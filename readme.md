# 🚀 Streamlit RAG Powered by Mistral 7B (4-bit) 

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by the **Mistral 7B** model quantized to 4-bit, hosted on **Runpod**. The frontend uses **Streamlit** for a simple, accessible UI and is hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**. It is designed for users who want to quickly extract meaningful information from uploaded documents (.txt, .pdf).  

You can upload files to create a **temporary knowledge base** that helps the AI generate accurate, document-aware responses.
